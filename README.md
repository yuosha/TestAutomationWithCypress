# TestAutomationWithCypress
Script that automates most frequent repetitive (Synerall) testing activities

This script was created in Spring 2020 in order to facilitate manual testing in Synerall team.
The purpose: creating new clients, meters, usage points, and different types of contracts was repetitive and time consuming.
Running these scripts with Cypress runner makes the job more fun and less time consuming. Also helps to avoid human errors in the process.
